## End of Life Statement

This repository is [End of Life](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/end-of-life-statement.md) that this software is no longer supported nor maintained by Packet or its community.

System Initialization for CoreOS
================================

CoreOS uses systemd for init and process management. This repo is
divided into three collections of files:

  * configs: Customized daemon configuration files, usually installed
    into ``/etc`` but really the sky is the limit there.
  * scripts: Helper scripts for init and service startup. These are
    generally to be used as systemd oneshot services and installed
    into ``/usr/lib/coreos``.
  * systemd: Unit files for mount points, our helper scripts, or other
    services that don't install their own unit files.

The coreos-base/coreos-init ebuild handles the install process.

Important Steps
---------------

A few notes on things that must happen which are unique to CoreOS.

  * resize btrfs: Support easy VM growth by checking
    if there is unused space at the end of the disk and expanding the
    filesystem to use it.
  * mount ``/``: This directory can be completely empty.
  * initialize ``/``: The ``/`` partition can be completely formatted by the
    user. Run systemd-tmpfiles to set everything up into a known state.
  * mount ``/usr``: The entire distro lives in this directory.
  * mount ``/usr/share/oem``: If an OEM is available on disk make sure it gets
    mounted here.
  * generate ssh keys: The stock sshd units do not handle this so
    we need to.
